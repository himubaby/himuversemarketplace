# HimuVerse Marketplace â€” Fixed (Vercel-ready)

This fixed package ensures the `pages/` directory exists at repo root and contains minimal pages needed for Next.js builds on Vercel. Upload this project (root) to GitHub and import to Vercel.

## Quick notes
- If you want full features (Prisma, PayPal, Play verify), use the upgraded zip previously provided and set env vars in Vercel.
- This fixed zip is designed to prevent the "Couldn't find any `pages` or `app` directory" build error.

## Run locally (optional)
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
